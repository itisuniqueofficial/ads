<script src="https://ads.itisuniqueofficial.com/ad-data.js"></script>
```

Or you can load it asynchronously with `defer`:

```html
<script defer src="https://ads.itisuniqueofficial.com/ad-data.js"></script>
```

### 2. Place the Ad Container

Wherever you want the ad to appear, place the following section:

```html
<section class="ad-container"></section>
```

üìå **Important:**

* One `<section class="ad-container"></section>` equals **one ad slot**.
* You can add multiple ad sections on a page.
* The script will automatically detect these sections and display ads in them.

</head>
<body>

  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
